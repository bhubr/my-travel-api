# MyTravelAPI

This API aims to provide data that can be used for educational projects (web apps, etc.).

The source code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/bhubr/my-travel-api).

Feel free to report any problem you encounter on the GitHub repository's [issues page](https://github.com/bhubr/my-travel-api/issues).

## Basic API usage

The simplest way to use this API is to query the main endpoint: <{{baseUrl}}/photos>.

Detailed [API docs](docs) (auto-generated with [apiDoc](https://apidocjs.com/)) are provided.

## Contribute your photos!

First, for disk space requirements, your photos will be uploaded in a low-resolution quality.

You're still the only owner of your photos, but by uploading a photo on this app, you consent to grant everyone the right to use it. You may or may not divulge your name via the API, but the API users have no obligation to credit the photographs in their apps,

In order to contribute photos, you need to sign in, using your GitHub account.

You'll then be able to access a photo upload form, where you may provide additional details.
